### Project Documentation (README.md):

Your project repository must contain a README.md file in the root directory. This file serves as your project documentation and must include the following sections (use appropriate Markdown formatting):
* Title Page Information: (Project Title, Course Name, Date)
* Group Members: (List all members)
* Introduction: (Brief overview of the project, its purpose, and the
importance of cryptography)
* Project Objectives: (List at least 3 specific objectives your project
aims to achieve)
* Discussions:
    * Describe the overall application architecture and UI choice.
    * For each implemented cryptographic algorithm:
        * Name and type (Symmetric/Asymmetric/Hash)
        * Brief history/background
        * Description of the process/how it works (can be high-level or include simplified pseudocode)
        * Libraries used for its implementation
        * How it's integrated into your application
* Sample Runs/Outputs:
    * Include screen snippets (screenshots) or text-based output examples for each algorithm's functionality (encryption, decryption, hashing for both text and files where applicable). Embed images directly in the README.md or link to them within the repository. Use Markdown code blocks for text output.
