- [x] Decide on UI framework (Flask)

## 2. Symmetric Algorithms Implementation (3 algorithms)
- [ ] Select 3 symmetric algorithms (e.g., AES, DES, Blowfish)
- [ ] Implement text encryption and decryption for each
- [ ] Implement file encryption and decryption for each
- [ ] Write test cases or sample runs for symmetric algorithms
- [ ] Document algorithm background, pseudocode, and integration

## 3. Asymmetric Algorithms Implementation (2 algorithms)
- [ ] Select 2 asymmetric algorithms (e.g., RSA, ECC)
- [ ] Implement text encryption and decryption for each
- [ ] Write test cases or sample runs for asymmetric algorithms
- [ ] Document algorithm background, pseudocode, and integration

## 4. Hashing Functions Implementation (4 functions)
- [ ] Select 4 hashing algorithms (e.g., SHA-256, MD5, SHA-1, BLAKE2)
- [ ] Implement hashing for text input
- [ ] Implement hashing for files
- [ ] Write test cases or sample runs for hashing functions
- [ ] Document algorithm background, pseudocode, and integration

## 5. User Interface Development
- [ ] Design UI layout and workflow
- [ ] Integrate encryption, decryption, and hashing functionalities into UI
- [ ] Add algorithm info sections (history, pseudocode, etc.) in UI
- [ ] Test UI with sample inputs (text and files)

## 6. Documentation (README.md)
- [ ] Write Project Title, Course Name, Date, Group Members
- [ ] Draft Introduction and Project Objectives
- [ ] Describe application architecture and UI choice
- [ ] Document each algorithm (name, type, background, description, libraries, integration)
- [ ] Include sample runs and output screenshots
- [ ] Review and finalize documentation formatting

## 7. Repository and Collaboration
- [ ] Establish Git branching and commit message conventions
- [ ] Ensure regular commits from all group members
- [ ] Review and merge pull requests
- [ ] Organize repository files and folders
- [ ] Prepare submission on LEONS platform

## 8. Testing and Finalization
- [ ] Conduct end-to-end testing (text and file operations)
- [ ] Fix bugs and optimize performance
- [ ] Final code cleanup and comments
- [ ] Final review of documentation and repository structure
